  <h1>Dancing throughout the Years</h1>

  <p>
    Dance is one of the main ways I stay creative and active at the University
    of Maryland and since I was a child. I currently dance on Maryland Dhoom, 
    a Bollywood fusion team, and enjoy learning choreography, performing, and 
    building community. I have been dancing since I was 2 years old and have 
    been on various teams and taken classes in different styles, from ballet to 
    hip hop to indian classical. Dance has been a constant source of joy and 
    growth for me, and I look forward to continuing to dance throughout my life 
    either at weddings or at competitions on a stage.

    Here is a teaser of a dance performance I was in as part of my dance school (Jungle Book, 2019):
